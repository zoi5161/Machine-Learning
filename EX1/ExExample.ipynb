    "Scenario (i): A coin classification system is created based on exact coin specifications from the U.S. Mint. This suggests that the system is using predefined, human-provided knowledge rather than learning from data. Hence, this would be an example of not learning, as no model is being trained using examples or experience.\n",

    "Question 10:\n",
    "For N = 100 training points, we are trying to estimate the probability $P[f(x) \\neq g(x)]$, which is the generalization error or the probability that the target function f and the hypothesis g learned by the Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) will disagree on a randomly chosen point $x \\in X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalization error with N = 100:\n",
    "\n",
    "With more training points, the hypothesis g will generally get closer to the target function f since PLA will have more data points to correctly classify. As N increases, the probability that g misclassifies points compared to f generally decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For N = 100, the number of training points is large enough for g to approximate f quite well. However, since PLA is a simple linear classifier, some disagreement is still expected, but it should be relatively small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical estimates for N = 100:\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical results and simulations for similar setups with N = 100 usually show that the disagreement probability $P[f(x) \\neq g(x)]$ falls around 0.01. This is because, with a decent number of training points, PLA can generalize well, but it is not perfect, and some misclassifications can still occur.\n",
