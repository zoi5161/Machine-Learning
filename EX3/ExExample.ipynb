    "In two dimensions, the Perceptron model cannot separate all of the possible configurations of four non-collinear points. However, by moving two of them out of the plane into a third dimension, they become separable. This implies that the breakpoint for a 3D Perceptron model in $ \\mathbb{R}^3 $ is at least five.\n",

    "Now, let the shadow effect be considered: the point that remains outside the tetrahedron always falls within the shadow of one of the faces of the tetrahedron. Since these shadow partition the space outside the tetrahedron, the external point will be forced to stay confined within one shadow. If we denote such a face by $ T $ and its shadowed points by $ S_T $, then the external point is going to be forced into one of these shadowed spaces.\n",

    "To illustrate further, let us color one point-for example, $ x_2 $ -red, and let all the other points, such as $ x_1 $, $ x_3 $, and $ x_5 $, be colored blue. Every plane that separates $ x_2 $ from this set must leave all points in $ S_T $ in the same halfspace as the blue points. This constraint forces the remaining point to share the color of those within $ S_T $, which would imply the set cannot be completely shattered.\n",

    "To approach this problem, let us first realize that any set of more than 3 points which can be shattered by a triangle has to be arranged in such a way that all of the points are on the convex hull.

    "With that in mind, the question of separating points along a convex hull using a triangle is a close cousin of the 3-interval model, except with one interesting twist: the points wrap around, so that the last point connects back to the first.

This configuration fails because the decision triangle would compress to include $ x_5 $ and $ x_6 $ as red as in Figure 5(c) or place $ x_3 $ outside the hull.
